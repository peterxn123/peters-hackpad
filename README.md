Hi! This is my hackpad created as part of Hack Club's hackpad YSWS program - hackpad.hackclub.com

To be honest, this was one of my first times using Fusion and my first ever time using KiCad! I wanted to make something with a clean slanted design for good ergonomic input, 6 keys, RGB neopixels for cool backlighting and a rotary encoder for volume control.
